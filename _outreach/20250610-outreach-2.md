Our research group proudly hosted the 2025 Scientific Computing Workshop, supported by the California Space Grant Consortium (CASGC). Held over two sessions in April, the workshop introduced undergraduate and graduate students to essential skills in Python programming, Git version control, Linux systems, and high-performance computing (HPC). Led by Dr. Ehsan Madadi and a team of student instructors, the event fostered hands-on learning in scientific computing and data-intensive programming. This initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to broadening access to computational tools that power innovation in engineering and beyond.
