Welcome to the MCF2 Lab at California State University, Long Beach. Our group specializes in advanced computational fluid dynamics, focusing on polydisperse multiphase fluid dynamics, turbulent scalar mixing, reacting flows, and complex fluid systems.  

The MCF2 Lab, short for Multiphase and Complex Fluids Flow Lab, underscores our research emphasis on polydisperse systems where interactions between disperse phases (such as particles, droplets, and bubbles) and the carrier medium are critical. These interactions are essential for understanding both natural phenomena and engineered applications. By delving into these complex interactions, we aim to develop innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and performance across a range of industrial and environmental contexts.
