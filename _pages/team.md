Join Our Team
======

**For Current CSULB Students:**

If you are a current student at CSULB interested in conducting research in our group for your Bachelor's or Master's thesis, I encourage you to first read our group's publications to familiarize yourself with our research areas. If you find a topic that resonates with your interests, please email me with the subject line "Interest in *specific topic*." In your email, include a brief description of how this topic aligns with your career aspirations and how you believe it will contribute to your future goals. I am always open to chatting, collaborating, and serving on committees if my time and expertise allows.

**For Prospective Students:**

Students who are considering applying to CSULB and are interested in joining the MCF2 Lab are encouraged to proceed with the university admission process. While I am eager to welcome new talents into our group, please note that I am unable to assist with admissions. All prospective students must be admitted to CSULB through the official admissions office. Once admitted, please reach out to me following the same guidelines provided for current students.
